# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to add an online ordering feature to allow orders to be placed ahead of schedule for fast pickup of coffee. I would also add a store locator to make it convenient to find a coffee shop nearby if there are multiple locations.
